        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hey there, yarn lovers! <br>I am so excited to finally start this little crochet blog‚Äîa space to document my stitches, share what I have learned, and maybe even connect with fellow crocheters out there.</p>
        <p>I picked up my first crochet hook not too long ago, and what started as a curiosity has quickly turned into something I look forward to every single day. I am still somewhere between beginner and intermediate, comfortable with the basics but still fumbling my way through more advanced techniques. And that is okay‚ò∫Ô∏è!</p>


        <h1>My Current Projectsüßµ </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Granny squares</li>
            <li>Crochet headbands</li>
            <li>Amigurumi attempt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><i>Granny Squares</i></h2>
        <p>The classic! I've been making colorful little squares that I can stitch together. It's teaching me patience and consistency.

        <h2><i>Crochet Headbands</i></h2>
        <p>These are super quick and satisfying to make. I've experimented with single crochet, double crochet, and even a little moss stitch pattern.</p>

        <h2><i>Amigurumi Attempt</i></h2>
        <p>I recently tried my first amigurumi charm,a small ladybugüêû. Let's just say it didn't exactly come out perfect‚Äîbut I'm proud I <del>messed up</del>tried!</p>


        <h1>Things I've Learned So Far‚ú® </h1>
        <ol>
        <li><p><b>Tension</b> is everything. Too tight? Struggles. Too loose? Gaps everywhere.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Frogging</b> (undoing stitches) is part of the journey. It's not a setback:it's learning in motion.</p></li>
        <li><p>YouTube is a lifesaver. When written patterns confuse me, a quick video helps everything click.</p></li>
        </ol>

    
        <h1>My Crochet GoalsüéØ </h1>
        <p>Learn how to read more complex patterns.<br>Start a wearable piece,maybe a crop top or a cardigan. <br>Improve on colour changing in tapestry.</p>


        <h3>Word of Encouragement</h3>
        <p>If you're just starting out too, here's my advice: don't stress about perfection. Your first projects might look a little wonky‚Äîbut they're still your creations. And every stitch you make is progress.</p>


        <p>I'll be sharing more updates, tips, and maybe even some patterns I try (or create!) soon. Let's keep growing stitch by stitch. Remember, Crochet + love = happiness<sup>2</sup></p>

        <p>With yarn and love,<br>Codess Mkhambe üß∂</p>
